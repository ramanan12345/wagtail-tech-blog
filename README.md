## The Wharton Tech Blog
A blog about the technology we use to build applications at Wharton, with an emphasis on our tech team's current stack (e.g., Django, Python, React.js, SASS, HTML5, CSS3, Gulp, etc.). We try to post 1 or 2 new articles each month.

## About the Blog

### Made with Wagtail CMS
We were introduced to <a href="https://wagtail.io">Wagtail CMS</a> during <a href="https://twitter.com/djangocon">Djangocon</a> 2015 in Austin, TX and were  impressed by it, so we decided to create a project using it. We like, for example, how it is "developer friendly" and that it's built on top of <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>. The admin is also powerful and easy to use.
