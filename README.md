## Introduction


We were introduced to [Wagtail CMS](https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail) during Djangocon 2015 in Austin and it got us thinking of ways we wanted to use it. We loved the simplicity and power of the admin and the flexibility that it gave us as developers. Furthermore TechBlog was born with the inspiration to help share knowledge within Wharton and others who may be interested. 

In short, we envisioned a blog with simple mechanics. While making it interesting to look at and modern using the tools we use everyday here at Wharton.
