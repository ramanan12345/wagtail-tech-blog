## The Wharton Tech Blog
The Wharton Tech Blog is a blog about the tech we use to build applications at Wharton, with an emphasis on our current stack (e.g., Django, Python, React.js, SASS, HTML5, CSS3, REST, Gulp, etc.). We try to post one or two new articles each month. Check it out here: <a href="https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/techblog">https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/techblog</a>.

## About the Blog

#### Made with Wagtail CMS
We were introduced to <a href="https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail">Wagtail CMS</a> during <a href="https://2015.djangocon.us">Djangocon</a> 2015 in Austin, TX and were impressed by it, so we decided to create a project using it (i.e., tech blog). 

Wagtail gave us content management (e.g., textfields, images, etc.), including one of the best mechanisms we've seen in a CMS for content creation called "<a href="https://wagtail.io/features/streamfield">Streamfield</a>," a beautiful admin interface and powerful permission tools. Plus, it's built on the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django Framework</a> (Wagtail is just a Django app) and written in Python. Though Wagtail provides key features, it allows the developer to do everything else. And, as developers, we like that.
